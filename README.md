# liri-node-app


1. Clearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why)

   LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. The user can only use the following command: 
   * concert-this
   * spotify-this-song

2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized

   * artist/band name and provide a list of venues with the following information:
      - Name of the venue
      - Venue location
      - Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")  
   * song title and provide a list every song with this title with the following information:
      - Artist(s)
      - The song's name
      - A preview link of the song from Spotify
      - The album that the song is from
   * movie title and provide some information about the movie and "Rotten Tomatoes":
      - Title of the movie.
      - Year the movie came out.
      - IMDB Rating of the movie.

      - Country where the movie was produced.
      - Language of the movie.
      - Plot of the movie.
      - Actors in the movie.
